Regularized Linear Regression and bias Varience
===================
Programming Exercise 3 in Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.  
The course info can be found here https://class.coursera.org/ml-004/class/index.

In this exercise, a logistic regression model to predict whether 
a student gets admitted into a university will be created step by step.  
The details of this assignment is described in ex5.pdf

The codes are written by Octave.
